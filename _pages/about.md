Hi! This is Shiyu, an architecture and interior designer. I always question how architecture can play a role in the Anthropocentric epoch, and how to make living spaces prefabricated and customized. Please refer to Aurora to see my project during my Postgraduate study. https://bpro2023.bartlettarchucl.com/rc5-product-architecture/aurora .If you are interested in my bachelor projects, please click here to see my portfolio. https://issuu.com/2544327750/docs/1216
